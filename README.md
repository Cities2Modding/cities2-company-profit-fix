# CompanyProfitFix for Cities Skylines II

## Features:
- Fixes the subsidies breaking introduced with 1.0.18f
- Fixes NaN values creating a high negative estimated profit for companies such as commercials, offices and industrials.
- The fix may address several issues in multiple areas of the simulation that we cannot measure such as rent, land value, or export and import.

## Important:
- **The fixed calculation needs a while to take effect. Please stay calm.**
- **The mod is activated globally**
- **It has an NO impact on your save. You can safely use this mod and remove it at anytime.**

## Requirement
- [BepInEx v5](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)

## Mod manager installation
I do recommend using the [Thunderstore.io mod manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) , or [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) for Game Pass users
